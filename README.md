Analyzing the Trends and Implications of Airborne Particulate Matter (PM) Pollution Caused by Gasoline-Related Sources: A Comprehensive Study of the United States from 2000 to 2022

**What is Particulate Matter?**
Particulate matter contains microscopic solids or liquid droplets that are so small that they can be inhaled and cause serious health problems. Some particles less than 10 micrometers (PM2.5) in diameter can get deep into your lungs and some may even get into your bloodstream.

**What are some gasoline-related sources of air pollution?**
The vapors given off when gasoline evaporates and the substances produced when gasoline is burned (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, sulphur dioxides and unburned hydrocarbons) contribute to air pollution. 

***Emissions from combustion of gasoline, oil, diesel fuel or wood produce much of the PM2. 5 pollution found in outdoor air.***
